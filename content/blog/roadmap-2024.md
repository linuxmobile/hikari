## Intro

Despite coding for approximately two years, I'm still fighting against **Impostor Syndrome**, that deep feeling that tells you _"you're not good enough"_ or _"you don't know enough"_.

Therefore, in 2024, I set out to focus on personal growth and increasing self-confidence. So I bring you my **Personal Roadmap** for 2024, to become a **Frontend** expert.

## Frontend

### Javascript:

I have a pretty good handle on **Javascript**. At the end of 2023, I participated in Advent coding challenges ([AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/)). Therefore, I'm pretty fresh on the logical and algorithmic parts.

Still, I'm very eager to review certain concepts:

- [Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays)
- [Equality Algorithms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)
- [Event Loops](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#what-is-the-event-loop)
- [Iterators & Generators](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/advanced-js/iteration-iterators)
- [Garbage Collection](https://javascript.info/garbage-collection)
- [Memory Lifecycle](https://medium.com/swlh/the-lifecycle-of-memory-in-javascript-5b5bffc5ff4cf)
- [Debugging Memory Leaks](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/debugging-javascript-memory-leaks)
- **Debugging performance**

As a goal for the first few months of this year, I would love to be able to tackle these topics in depth and take another step with **Javascript**. Mastering **Javascript** is not a difficult task, but mastering the more advanced aspects is. That's the point I want to reach!

### React:

Something similar happens with **React**. I haven't finished learning it 100%, so it's ultra necessary for me to go back, stop, study. And thus stop solving issues on the fly.

When working with **Next.js**, it happens that I don't remember some things, so I refer to the documentation and continue. I'd like to leave that documentation dependency. Therefore, I would like to review the following topics:

- Hooks:
  - [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
  - [useMemo](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usememo-hook/)
- React Router & Reach Router
- GraphQL:
  - Apollo
- Jest, Vitest, PlayWright. (_It's about time, isn't it?_)
- Axios, SWR
- **React Native**

### Vue.js

This year I set out to learn **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**. To leave that dependency on _Next.js_ that some of us have.

- From 0 to 100%. (_Practically, I don't know Vue.js, so I have to study everything._)

### Design Patterns and Design Systems

### Atomic Design

### BEM and SUIT

### Quik

## Rust

By mid-year I would like to start with **Rust**. Almost my entire suite of tools from [my NixOS configuration](https://github.com/linuxmobile/kaku) is written in **Rust**.

Why did I migrate all my tools to alternatives written in **Rust**? For the speed, performance, memory consumption and more.

So, to get closer to that **dream** I have of creating **Free Software** tools for **Linux**, I want to start with this small _or huge_ step.

## Typescript

While I already know the basics of **Typescript**, it's not that different from **JS**. I would like to go much deeper and become an _advanced "Typescripter"!_
